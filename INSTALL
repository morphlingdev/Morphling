Download the Repo

To begin the installation process, you must first fork the source code into your Github account.

Step 1: Fork the "Morphling" repo

To fork this project, click the "Fork" button. Right now, though, the source files are only on Github, and you must clone the project on the computer to compile or to work on the project.

Step 2: Clone the "Morphling" repo

Run the following code:
	$ git clone git@github.com:username/Morphling.git
Replace username with your user name.

Step 3: Configure remotes

When a repo is cloned, it has a default remote called origin that points to your fork on GitHub, not the original repo it was forked from. To keep track of the original repo, you need to add another remote named upstream:
	$ cd Morphling
	$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/morphlingdev/Morphling.git
	$ git fetch upstream

Compile the Source Code

This program uses make to compile itself. Download GNU Make here. To compile, simply run:
	$ cd Morphling
	$ make
This makes executable Morphling in the same folder.

Run Morphling

To run, simply open Morphling.

Updating

Since Morphling is currently in Alpha stage, it is constantly being updated. To update, run the following code:
	$ cd Morphling
	$ git fetch upstream
	$ git merge upstream/master
	$ make clean
	$ make
Then run Morphling.


*UPDATE: An installer package is now available for the Windows platform. It is now possible to download it directly from the Github repository. However, cloning the repo and building the game yourself is still highly recommended given the constant need to update the game. By building it from source, you could also help us squash bugs :P.
